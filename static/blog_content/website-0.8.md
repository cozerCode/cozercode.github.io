# <span id="top">The website is here! </span>

### <span id="intro">Intro:

&emsp;Hello! I'm Cozer and this is my first blog!
&emsp;So, I've been working on this website for a while, and I quite like working on it in my free time.I planned on making it simple and cozy, with an orginized code.\
&emsp;I also tried using vanilla javascript and no extra npm dependencies, <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, css as much as I can, and this is how it turned out!

### <span id="new">New features:
 
This is the first public beta version `0.921` of the website, and it features:
 * The landing website page. <sub>ofc</sub>
 * <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> including system.
 * Separated files for the `footer` and the `navigtion bar` To make it easier to use it in multiple pages.
 * Seperated files for blog content instead of a whole new page for every blog.
 * "`404 - Page Not Found`" page, when researching for unexsisting blog.
 * The text in the main page is now more responsive.

### <span id="next">What's next?
 
-I'm going to try adding more blogs and features actively.\
Here's what I will blog:
 1. Website devlogs.
 2. Gamedev Devlogs.
 3. Other programming devlogs.
 4. Personal opinion about stuff.
 
Here's what I will add:
 * Change and add some content instead of `will be updated later`.
 * Feedback form.
